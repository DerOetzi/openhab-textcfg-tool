# openhab-textcfg-tool

## Description

This is a toolset to manage the Smart Home Software OpenHAB with text configuration files.
The advantage of using text files is you can use git as version management.

There is although included a small template-engine included so you can reuse parts for your configuration file.

And you will be able to use a public git-repository to share your configuration without disposing any sensible data.
